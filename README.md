## Additional Options

You can create an executable `.sh` or `.command` file to simplify running the project:

1. Create an executable file using a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano run.sh   
2. Add the following content to the file:
   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```
 Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X in nano).

4. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
5. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

For macOS users creating a .command file, follow the same steps but name the file run.command. The execution process remains the same.
